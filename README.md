# todo-app-vue-node

Tech test - Lucian Iernye

## Steps:

- clone the project: git clone + url
- cd into the main/root folder
- run: npm install and wait for the completion
- run: npm run install-all and wait for the completion
- run: npm start and wait for the completion
- The app is now online on http://localhost:8080/
- To add a new todo press the button Add Todo and fill the required information

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

There is no need to install an additional database as I used my mongodb cloud account to store the data.<br />
At the moment, the UI of the app only allows to add and to delete a todo to/from the list.<br />
In the backend I created the endpoints to support to update the todo item, but I didn't had the time to make it work properly as for some reason is failing to update the status of completed or uncompleted in the backend.<br />
